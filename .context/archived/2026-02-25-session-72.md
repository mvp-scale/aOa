# Session 72 | 2026-02-25 | L5 Dimension Rules + Optimization

> **Session**: 72

## Now

1. Resume L5: dimension rules for L5.7/L5.8 per-rule detection validation
2. L7.2: database storage optimization (964MB bbolt, 28.7s load)
3. L4.4: installation docs

## Done

- [x] Moved 11 triple-green tasks to COMPLETED.md: P0 (B7, B9, B10, B11, B14, B15, B17), L3.15, L6.8, L6.9, L6.10
- [x] Marked L4.2 (Grammar CLI download) as superseded -> BACKLOG.md (G2 split made dynamic download irrelevant)
- [x] L6 layer now fully complete (all 10 tasks done)
- [x] L3 layer now fully archived (all 15 tasks in COMPLETED.md)
- [x] Rebuilt INDEX.md with updated board pointers and layer status
- [x] **L7.2: Binary encoding** -- replaced JSON with binary posting lists + gob. 20x smaller (75MB->3.7MB for 50K tokens). Lazy v0->v1 migration. 5 tests + 4 benchmarks. All 25 bbolt tests pass.
- [x] **AOA_SHIM=1** -- env var for explicit Unix shim mode. Fixed 3 bugs: fallback arg forwarding (os.Args[1:]->os.Args[2:]), silent errors (now print to stderr), test assertions (grep-compat format). 9 integration tests fixed. 18/18 packages pass.
- [x] L2.1 now triple-green on board (was already validated, INDEX was stale)
- [x] Moved L2.1 and L7.2 to COMPLETED.md (both triple-green)
- [x] Fixed shim scripts in init.go to include `export AOA_SHIM=1`
- [x] Cleaned up stale L2 quality gate note in BOARD.md

## Next

- L5.10/L5.11: dimension scores in search results + query support
- L7.3/L7.4: recon source view, .aoa/ restructure
